# Alpine-Spine
Immutable Alpine-based host with a locked boot spine and bay0 PID-1 warden. The base never changes. All functionality lives in signed, disposable pods (personas) with strict resource ceilings, network isolation, and watchdog enforcement. Shells and embodiments define UX and price tiers without touching the core.
